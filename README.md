# HealthcareAnalytics
Currently I am working to secure data from the clinic I currently work at- Intrepid Spirit Fort Campbell in order to do real time analysis on no-show data and how to improve clinic efficiency on a local level. Due to it being a government entity I am working on how to share the analysis for my project and am hopeful to have that data at a later time. Since I currently cannot disclose that data I will be sharing mock up analysis on a dataset from Kaggle.com along with analysis specific to a region, Philadelphia,PA to be exact. 
I am going to attempt to tell a story about the current status of a region in regards to healthcare resources and needs along with showing a developing trend with overdose data. 
This exploration is of no show data that is available on Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments. This set includes 300,000 unique encounters. For data cleaning I removed NA's and variables that were not needed in order to have a better look at the data. I also had to delete data that was clearly erroneous. For example having the variable Age>0 and omitting any negative numbers. I also divided it into No-Show and Show up data.

From the OpenDataPhilly initiative it is easy to see where the police force needs to be concentrated in order to increase the efficiency of it's people for public safety. This is the start of the Philadelphia exploration.
