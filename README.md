# HealthcareAnalytics
Currently I am working to secure data from the clinic I currently work at- Intrepid Spirit Fort Campbell in order to do real time analysis on no-show data and how to improve clinic efficiency on a local level. Due to it being a government entity I am working on how to share the analysis for my project and am hopeful to have that data at a later time. Since I currently cannot disclose that data I will be sharing mock up analysis on a dataset from Kaggle.com along with analysis specific to a region, Philadelphia,PA to be exact. 
I am going to attempt to tell a story about the current status of a region in regards to healthcare resources and needs along with showing a developing trend with overdose data.
